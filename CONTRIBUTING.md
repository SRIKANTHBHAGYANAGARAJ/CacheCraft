# Contributing to CacheCraft

Contributions are most effective when they begin with a small fixture that demonstrates the intended input and expected analysis result. Open an issue to discuss larger changes, keep parser and report contract changes explicit, and update relevant docs with every user-facing workflow change.

## Development loop
1. Run the project's compile target from the Makefile.
2. Exercise a command-line example against a fixture.
3. Keep output stable, readable and structured for downstream tooling.
4. Describe the motivation, data shape and report impact in the pull request.

## Review focus
Reviewers look for clear domain modeling, deterministic calculations, useful diagnostics and examples that reflect proposed behavior.
